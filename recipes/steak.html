        <p>Embark on a culinary misadventure with our Inferno Delight Steak, a symphony of questionable choices that redefine "the concept of a perfect steak. Picture a cut of meat so economically humble it could moonlight as cardboard. We take this culinary canvas and marinate it in an unholy union of liquid smoke and barbecue sauce, transforming it into a charred relic of flavorless extravagance. </p>
        
        <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cardboard-like steak</li>
            <li>2 cups of smoke</li>
            <li>1 gallon barbecue sauce</li>
            <li>rubber tire shavings</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin with the cheapest, toughest steak you can find. Quality is the enemy in this culinary adventure.</li>
            <li>Marinate the steak in the barbecue sauce for a minimum of 24 hours. The longer, the better we want the flavor to be completely unrecognizable.</li>
            <li>Place the steak on a baking sheet, liberally sprinkling ground rubber tire shavings for that unmistakable burnt essence. If you don't have tire shavings, any random non-food item will do.</li>
            <li>Bake the steak until it resembles a charred relic from a culinary disaster movie. Keep a fire extinguisher handy, just in case things get too "exciting."</li>
            <li>Remove the steak from the oven and let it rest in a pool of its own questionable juices. This step is crucial for allowing the flavors to fully meld into a symphony of regret.</li>
        </ol>
